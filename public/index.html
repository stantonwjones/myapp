                    <p>Well, now that I am the proud owner of stantonwjones.com for the next ten years, I figured I should do something with it.  First and foremost, credits:

                            <li>
                            Dad, thanks for the many lessons you have taught me and the infinite patience you've shown in the teaching.  Even though I know you are proud of me, I feel I have yet to do justice the prime example you have set for me.  Having you as a father makes me feel like the fabled ten-talented man.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Mom, the depth of love and faith that you have in me, though overwhelming at times, is a neverending comfort to me.  Even though you are near the other side of the world, I can feel you worrying about me.  You have, and always will be the grounding force in my life as every day I see the maxims you've passed down across the generations continue to hold truth and wisdom.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Walter, although I don't call as often as I should, I just want you to know that I love you.  Watching your strength and amazing ability to open any door in life without waiting for opportunity to knock is a source of endless inspiration to me.  You have shown me how to survive with dignity in this world, and I hope that one day I'll learn to be half as assertive and confident as you are.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Unfortunately, I am working on multiple things at once, and this will mostly serve as my 'Hello World' to, well, the world.  Literally</p>
